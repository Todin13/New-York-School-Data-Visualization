# New-York-School-Data-Visualization

The project's purpose is to set criterias that'd allow us to find a school ranking method appropriate for the NY State, excluding the idea that graduation rate is the only factor to a school's success. The data was collected from schools between 1999 and 2022.

## Our reschearch question :

How to set up criteria to lead to a ranking methodology adapted to the State of New York when expectations today are multiple and are not limited to exam results?

## How we did it :

All was done on Power BI and Power Query.
