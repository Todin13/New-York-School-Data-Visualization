# New-York-School-Classement

The project's purpose is to set criterias that would allow us to find a school ranking method appropriate for the NY State, excluding the idea that graduation rate is the only factor to a school's success. The data was collected from schools between 1999 and 2022, but here we only use the data from 2021-2022.

## Presentation of the databases 
 
The database concerns all school.
For durther explanation when downlading the database you have a readme for the explanation. Only Theacher Grade does not have one but there is not one in our year of study.

## Our reschearch question :

How to set up criteria to lead to a ranking methodology adapted to the State of New York when expectations today are multiple and are not limited to exam results?

## Our Criteria :

The Result of the regent Exam,
The Experience of the Teachers,
The Ratio Students Teachers (number of students for one teacher),
The Expenditure by Students,
The Accountability Level,

## Must Know about the Criteria :

The Regent Exam are exams passed in the State of New York in Elementary and High School. In the DataBase a teacher is considerated inexperiimented under four year of practise in school. For Expenditure by Students the expenditure are calculated by the division of the Federal and Local/State expenditure by the number of students. The accountability level is the average of the levels of different criteria : Chronic Absenteism, Core PErformance, Weight Performance, Grad Rate and ELP for both Elementary and High School.

## How we did it :

All was done on Power BI and Power Query. Go to the section code in the github to see the code in M for power query to clean the data and the DAX code for the creation of the new tables, columns and measures necessary for the analysis. For the scrapping of the geographic coordinates of the schools you will also have access to the python code.
